2. Establish Evaluation Framework
Framework: Goal-Question-Metric (GQM) Approach
The evaluation framework will be structured around the GQM approach to systematically assess the effectiveness, quality, and relevance of LLM-generated NFRs.

Goal
Evaluate the effectiveness of LLMs in generating NFRs from FRs with an emphasis on coverage, clarity, relevance, and alignment with industry standards.

Questions and Corresponding Metrics
Coverage:

Question: Can LLMs generate comprehensive and diverse NFRs that cover the major quality attributes (e.g., security, performance, usability)?
Metrics:
Coverage Ratio: Percentage of quality attributes addressed in the generated NFRs compared to a predefined baseline or standard (e.g., IEEE 830 standards).
Diversity Index: Number of unique quality attributes addressed per FR.
Clarity:

Question: Are the generated NFRs clearly articulated and free from ambiguity?
Metrics:
Expert Evaluation Score: Average clarity score on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = Poorly written, 5 = Very clear).
Ambiguity Ratio: Proportion of generated NFRs flagged as ambiguous by reviewers.
Relevance:

Question: Do the generated NFRs align with the context and domain of the given FRs?
Metrics:
Relevance Score: Average rating by domain experts for relevance (1 = Not relevant, 5 = Highly relevant).
Context Match Rate: Percentage of NFRs judged to be contextually appropriate.
Consistency:

Question: Are the generated NFRs internally consistent and free of contradictions?
Metrics:
Consistency Index: Percentage of NFRs without contradictions when reviewed together.
Redundancy Reduction Rate: Number of redundant NFRs removed during post-processing.
Efficiency:

Question: How does the time required for LLM-generated NFRs compare with manual elicitation?
Metrics:
Time Savings: Average time saved per FR compared to manual methods.
Iteration Reduction: Number of iterations needed to finalize NFRs using LLM-generated outputs versus traditional approaches.
Stakeholder Perception:

Question: How do stakeholders (e.g., software engineers, project managers) perceive the quality and utility of the generated NFRs?
Metrics:
User Satisfaction Score: Stakeholder feedback on a Likert scale (1 = Very dissatisfied, 5 = Very satisfied).
Adoption Rate: Percentage of generated NFRs accepted without significant modifications.
Evaluation Methodology

Baseline Comparison:

Use a predefined set of FRs with manually curated NFRs as a baseline.
Compare LLM-generated NFRs with this baseline using the defined metrics.
Expert Validation:

Involve domain experts to assess clarity, relevance, and consistency using structured surveys and feedback forms.
Empirical Study:

Conduct controlled experiments where participants use LLM-assisted and traditional methods to elicit NFRs from the same set of FRs.
Iterative Improvement:

Use feedback to refine prompts, post-processing rules, and evaluation scripts, ensuring continuous improvement of results.
Implementation Plan for Metrics Collection
Automate metrics calculation (e.g., coverage, consistency) where possible using custom scripts.
Develop Likert-scale surveys for expert validation.
Use tools (e.g., spreadsheets or database systems) to track and analyze feedback efficiently.
