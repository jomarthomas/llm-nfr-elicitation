# Leveraging Large Language Models for Automating Non-Functional Requirements Elicitation in Software Engineering: Enhancing Efficiency and Coverage

## Project Overview
This project explores how Large Language Models (LLMs) can be leveraged to automate the generation of Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs) from Functional Requirements (FRs). The goal is to improve the efficiency, coverage, and quality of NFR elicitation in software engineering projects.

The repository includes:
- Preprocessing scripts to prepare datasets.
- JavaScript-based pipeline for generating NFRs using LLMs.
- Full-stack prototype with a ReactJS frontend and a NodeJS backend.
- Evaluation scripts to measure the effectiveness of the approach.

## Key Features
- **Automated NFR Elicitation**: Generates NFRs based on FR inputs using LLMs.
- **Full-Stack Prototype**: Provides a user-friendly interface for FR-to-NFR generation.
- **Evaluation Framework**: Implements metrics to assess clarity, relevance, and coverage of generated NFRs.
- **Scalable JavaScript Implementation**: Built entirely using JavaScript for seamless development.
